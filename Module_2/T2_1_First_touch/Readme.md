**Objective:** Using standard I/O-streams in C++ to output a constant string.

In this task, you are required to 
**implement function** `Hello()` **that outputs** 

```
Hello world!
```

**followed by a newline.** 

> **CAUTION**
> You should not use the `printf()` function of C
> standard library, but instead use C++ streams and functions that are declared 
> in `iostream` header.

The template contains `first.cpp` file with empty `Hello` function 
definition. Write your solution into the empty function definition.
