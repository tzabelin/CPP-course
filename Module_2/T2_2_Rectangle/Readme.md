**Objective:** Practice standard I/O streams.

In this task you are required to **implement function** ``Rectangle``. 
The function must be able perform te following I/O operations.

1. Asks two double values for the width and height of the rectangle from the 
   standard input stream. 

   The function should ask for the input by first printing the following 
   string on the standard output.

   ```

    Please enter width and height
   ```
   > **User input can be any floating point numbers.**

2.  Outputs the area and circumference of the rectangle as shown below.
    
    ```
        Area: 7.5
        Circumference: 11
    ```

    when the user inputs

    ```
        Please enter width and height
        2.5 3.0
    ```


> **CAUTION**:
>
>    You should use the C++ **iostream** functions, not the traditional
>    C-style I/O. In the tests, the user inputs are randomly selected, so you
>    are required to actually calculate the area and circumference of a rectangle.
