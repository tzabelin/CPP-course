**Objective:** Practice basic functions of `vector` class of standard C++ library.

In this exercise you will need to implement the following three functions 
that operate on given *int* - type vectors (i.e. `vector<int>` ).

1. `GetMin` that will return the smallest value stored in the vector.    

2. `GetMax` that will return the largest value stored in the vector.

3. `GetAvg` that will return the average of the values stored in the
    vector. The returned value will be of *double* type, even though
    the input values are *int*.
